Breakout
========

A Breakout clone that I've been working on

This game uses the pygame library, and is written in Python.

The text for the "Start" screen and the game itself was created by me using GIMP. Hence why it looks awful.

The sprites come from http://opengameart.org/content/breakout-graphics.
Many thanks to whoever "Marcus" is for designing the tile set.

The "drugs" screen comes from http://theawesomer.com/winners-dont-use-drugs-tee/96882/ originally.
I'm not sure where they got it from.
